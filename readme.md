This is a D2 binding to the [AntTweakBar](http://anttweakbar.sourceforge.net) library.

AntTweakBar is a small and easy-to-use C/C++ library that allows programmers
to quickly add a light and intuitive GUI into OpenGL and DirectX based
graphic programs to interactively tweak parameters.

Currently the D binding targets version **116**.
