This is a D2 binding to the [AntTweakBar](http://anttweakbar.sourceforge.net) library.

AntTweakBar is a small and easy-to-use C/C++ library that allows programmers
to quickly add a light and intuitive GUI into OpenGL and DirectX based
graphic programs to interactively tweak parameters.

Currently the D binding targets AntTweakBar **v116**.

## Examples

The original AntTweakBar source package itself has many examples of usage.
There is a small D example in the `examples` directory, but currently it's not
buildable via dub since some dependencies are not available as dub packages yet.
